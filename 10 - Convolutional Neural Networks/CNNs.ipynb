    "\n",
    "### 1.1: Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of the exercise we will revisit the MNIST dataset of hand-written digits, and we will train deep net models to classify the digits. Instead of doing all the hard coding work manually, we will simplify our life by using a deep learning framework: PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week we have implemented our own Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), where we defined both the forward pass and back-propagation together with a simple optimizer (SGD update rule) and successfully trained it to perform classification. Given the amount of code written, one can imagine that prototyping with various NN architectures and training strategies might get tedious. That is where PyTorch (and other deep learning frameworks) come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2: About PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an optimized tensor library for deep learning using GPUs and CPUs. It allows\n",
    "for fast prototyping by providing high-level access to all necessary building blocks, including NN layers, activation functions, loss functions, and optimizers, to name a few. Most importantly, however, PyTorch implements the [autograd](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html) package, which allows for automatic differentiation of the operations we use to define NN architectures. In other words, one only has to implement the forward pass, namely to combine desired layers, while the **backpropagation is computed automatically**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3: Basic pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "To define and train deep net models, one would usually implement the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Load the dataset.\n",
    "    2. Define and instantiate a deep net architecture.\n",
    "    3. Choose or implement a loss function (such as the mean squared error).\n",
    "    4. Choose and instantiate an optimizer (such as the SGD).\n",
    "    5. For each batch in the dataset:\n",
    "        5.1. Load a batch.\n",
    "        5.2. Run a forward pass through your model.\n",
    "        5.3. Compute the loss.\n",
    "        5.4. Run a backward pass, i.e., compute gradients of the loss w.r.t. the trainable parameters (weights).\n",
    "        5.5. Update the weights using the optimizer.\n",
    "        5.6. Zero-out the accumulated gradients before the next iteration.\n",
    "        \n",
    "We will see this exact pipeline in our code as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4: Essential bulding blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "This section gives a high-level summary of the most important components representing the bare minimum that you will need to start playing with PyTorch and deep net models.

    "#### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "We are at step (2) of the training pipeline. We will start by implementing an MLP consisting of a 1D input layer (we flatten, i.e., vectorize, the input image) of shape ($784$, ), $3$ hidden fully connected layers and an output layer of shape ($10$, ), as we have $10$ classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you saw last week, one layer of an MLP computes the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\yb = \\sigma \\left(\\mathbf{W}^\\top\\xb + \\mathbf{b}\\right), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ is the activation, $\\mathbf{W}$ is the weight, and $\\mathbf{b}$ the bias. The type of layer that computes $\\mathbf{W}^\\top\\xb + \\mathbf{b}$ is referred to as *fully-connected* (FC) because every input is connected to every output (recall the MLP diagram from the lectures). Additionally, we also call them *linear* layers because they compute a linear function with respect to their input (plus a bias).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimization criterion\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to interpret the output vector $\\hat{\\yb} \\in \\real^{10}$ as the probabilities of data sample $\\xb \\in \\real^{784}$ belonging to each class $j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ..., 9\\}$. Therefore, we will make use of the activation function **softmax**, defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{\\yb}^{(j)} = P(\\text{class}=j|\\zb) = \\mathrm{Softmax}_j(\\zb) = \\frac{\\exp{\\zb_{(j)}}}{\\sum_{k=0}^{9}{\\exp{\\zb_{(k)}}}}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "on the final output of our network $\\zb$ (these values pre-softmax are referred to as \"logits\").\n",
    "The softmax guarantees that $\\sum_{k=0}^{9}{\\hat{\\yb}_{k}} = 1$ and $\\yb_j \\geq 0, \\, \\forall j$, meaning that out predicted vector $\\hat\\yb$ is indeed a valid probability distribution over classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we would like to match the predicted distribution $\\hat{\\yb}$ to the ground truth (GT) one $\\yb$, where $\\yb$ is given as a one-hot encoding ($\\yb$ is all zeros except for a $1$ at the index $j$, if $j$ is the correct class to be predicted). The optimization criterion of choice is then to minimize the [**cross-entropy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy) (CE) of $\\hat{\\yb}$ and $\\yb$. Therefore our final loss function $L$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L = \\text{CE}\\left(\\hat{\\yb}, \\yb\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, PyTorch provides the implementation of $L$, **so you will only really need to provide the output $\\zb$** (i.e. the 10-dimensional output of your last layer *before* the softmax). We will get back to $L$ later.\n",

    "Each custom NN architecture you choose to implement has to subclass the [`nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#module), which conveniently keeps track of all the trainable parameters. From the programmer's perspective, you have to implement the constructor (`__init__`) and override the `forward()` function:\n",

    "- **forward()**\n",
    "\n",
    "This function really defines the architecture, as you will sequentally call your layers in the desired order. Each time you call `forward()` (every training iteration), the so-called **computational graph** is built. It is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of nodes corresponding to the operations you have called. Each node defines the derivative of its outputs w.r.t. its inputs. The computational graph is then traversed in the reversed fashion once you call `backward()` and the derivatives are computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the trainable parameters, which your model consists of, can be accessed via a call to `model.parameters()` implemented in `nn.Module`. This comes in handy once instantiating your optimizer as you have to pass all the parameters you want it to manage.\n",

In order to avoid this, we can allow the kernel to go slightly beyond the original signal by padding it with zeros at its beginning and end.\n",

However, if we add one $0$ at the beginning and at the end of the input, therefore changing its effective size to $6$, the kernel will be able to move four times over it, which will give an output of size $4$, the same as the original input.\n",
